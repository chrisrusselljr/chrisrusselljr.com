## You’re already awesome.

You don't need anyone to verify this.

Good teammates/managers will tell you what to work on. 

They’re called blind spots for a reason.

Ask *specific* questions if you have them.

Let people rip into your work. Don’t get defensive. Thank them profusely.

Let your guard down.

Listen to their words, hear what they say, then do what you want – others will do the same.

Show people you see them. Look at them. Say "good morning".

Skip the code speak - say exactly what’s on your mind.

Authenticity = candor + directness

And most importantly:

Show you care first, or else you’ll just sound like an asshole.
