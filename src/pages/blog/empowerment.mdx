## If you don’t have a plan for yourself, you’ll become a part of someone else's.

Nothing will be given to you.

Determine what you want and the necessary steps to get there.

Then execute, every day, without apology. 

Empowerment means *you* are in control of your path.

<br />

## Success is rarely polite. 

**Everyone** is competing to get to the next level.

If you’re good at what you do, consider yourself a resource.

Be helpful, but not at the cost of your plan.

To compromise your bandwidth is stagnation.
